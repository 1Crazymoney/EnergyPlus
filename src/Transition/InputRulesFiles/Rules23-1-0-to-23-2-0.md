Input Changes version 23.1.0 to 23.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: SurfaceProperty:LocalEnvironment

The third field (third character string) was renamed from External Shading Fraction Schedule Name to Sunlit Fraction Schedule Name.  This was just a name change to the field to better clarify what this is.  No changes to how it is read in or interpretted inside the code were made.


# Object Change: OBJECT NAME HERE
