# This file documents the structural changes on the output of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
# This will eventually become a more structured file, but currently it isn't clear what format is best.
# As an intermediate solution, and to allow the form to be formed organically, this plain text file is being used.
# Entries should be clearly delimited.  It isn't expected that there will be but maybe a couple each release at most.
# Entries should also include some reference back to the repo.  At least a PR number or whatever.

# Example output change
The output tables were changed so that all column headers are now in ALL CAPS to ensure users are alerted to their presence.
This affects the SQL as well as other tabular output.

# Next output change
The plant pump models have had some wording changes.  Use of the word *Rated* has been changed to *Design*. The reason is that these values are not really ratings in the sense that they correspond to the results of a standard rating system or a specific rating point that might appear in product catalog data.  Rather they are just the design values used in the pump model calculations.  This affects not only the input fields in the pump objects, but also the strings reported for sizing outcomes.  

For version 8.5, the strings used to report pump sizes have changed In the EIO file and table summary reports in the following ways: 

    Rated Flow Rate [m3/s] => Design Flow Rate [m3/s]
    Initial Rated Flow Rate [m3/s] => Initial Design Flow Rate [m3/s]
    Rated Power Consumption [W] => Design Power Consumption [W]
    Initial Rated Power Consumption [W] => Initial Design Power Consumption [W]
