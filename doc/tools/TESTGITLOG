fe365b1 Updated two example files so that they worked properly with the fix to DSOA. The old versions of the example files showed as flow per zone but because the flow per person was field was defaulting to a value and being used in the calculations it was actually providing flow. The change to the example files explicitly is providing the same amount of flow and is shown as flow per person.

beef1dc Re-implement a static library step in the build process  - This has the benefit of allowing unit tests to link statically so we dont need to decorate all the unit test functions and variables as we add more unit tests  - This causes a 3-layer build process:    - First build a static library of nearly all the EnergyPlus source code.  Unit tests are linked against this    - Second build a shared library that is linked against the static library and EnergyPlusPgm.cc, which just exposes the public API    - Third build the EnergyPlus binary which is a super thin wrapper over the shared library
