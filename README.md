EnergyPlusTeamPrep
==================

Things done:
 - E+ builds in standalone mode, against the Objexx library
 - Works on Linux, haven't tried other yet
 - External libraries build also, but E+ doesn't link to them yet
 - CMake successfully made an eclipse project

Things to work on:
 - Get E+ building against all the libraries
 - Need to add the testing tools into this repo and customize it for the executable structure
 - Once ready, push it into EnergyPlusTeam
 - Keep it in sync with the C++ dev code, work on testing further
 - For now, make sure it can build EPMacro, etc. (FORTRAN pieces)
