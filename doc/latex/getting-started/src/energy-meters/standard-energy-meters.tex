\section{Standard Energy Meters}\label{standard-energy-meters}

Meters provide one way for EnergyPlus to report energy use in a form that is pallatable to the users. The primary implemented method for output gives very fine detail (down to the variable level) for results from EnergyPlus. However, to get the required energy use, there may be several variables that need to be polled and accumulated. The meter implementation for EnergyPlus accomplishes this reporting.

Meters can be used to typify energy use by type and by component. The diagrams and tables illustrate how the meters have been incorporated into EnergyPlus.

As shown in the figure above, energy use for the facility is grouped according to fuel type (see Table~\ref{table:table-of-metered-fuel-types}. Table of Metered Fuel Types), by meter type (see Table~\ref{table:overall-meter-types}. Overall Meter Types) and by end use category type (see Table~\ref{table:end-use-category-types}. End Use Category Types).

Both the fuel types and enduse types are set within the program by the developers. Current Fuel types are shown in the table below. There is also a special category called ``EnergyTranser''.
