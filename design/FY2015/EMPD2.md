## Justification for New Feature ##

Moisture adsorption and desorption from materials has a significant effect on a building's humidity. One option for modeling this in EnergyPlus is the Effective Moisture Penetration Depth (EMPD) model, but the current implementation is limited in its accuracy. An improvement to this model is proposed, which solves the equations differently and includes a deep layer to account for longer-term moisture buffering. These two changes result in a significantly more accurate model, which has been demonstrated with a comparison to the more detailed Combined Heat and Moisture Transfer (HAMT) model in EnergyPlus, and a comparison to whole-house field tests.

## Overview and Approach ##

This New Feature will replace the existing implementation of the EMPD model in EnergyPlus. It requires some of the same inputs as the current EMPD model, but some additional inputs as well (which enable the higher accuracy).

The new EMPD model simulates the effect of the materials on the air humidity with two fictious layers of material with uniform moisture content: a surface layer, which accounts for short-term moisture buffering, and a deep layer, which accounts for more slowly responding moisture buffering. The model calculates the moisture transfer between the air and the surface layer and between the surface layer and the deep layer. This moisture transfer impacts the zone temperature (through latent-to-sensible conversion) and humidity in the same manner as the existing EMPD model.

## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

The figure below, from Woods et al., 2013, shows how the new implementation of the EMPD model (labeled EMPD2) matches the more rigorous HAMT model in EnergyPlus more accurately than the exiting EMPD model (labeled EMPD1).

The next figure, from Woods et al., 2014, shows good agreement between the new implementation of the EMPD model with data from a whole-house field test.

## Input Description ##

The inputs for the proposed EMPD model include the five for the existing model. As described in the current Input/Output Reference, the first input is the effective moisture penetration depth of the material layer. This will be changed to the "...penentration depth of the material *surface* layer" in the proposed model. The last four inputs (a,b,c, and d) are  coefficients to define the relationship between the materialâ€™s moisture content and the surface air relative humidity.

Two new inputs are required. The first is the moisture permeability of the material, which is assumed constant. The second is the moisture penetration depth of the material *deep* layer.

## Outputs Description ##

In addition to the outputs of the existing EMPD model, the new model will also include:

 - Equilibrium RH of the surface layer
 - Equilibrium RH of the deep layer
 - Mass flux (or mass transfer) between the surface and deep layers

## Example File and Transition Changes ##

Inputs for the existing EMPD model are as follows:

```
  MaterialProperty:MoisturePenetrationDepth:Settings,
    MaterialName,         !- Name
    0.00,                 !- Moisture Penetration Depth {m}
    0.00,                 !- Moisture Equation Coefficient a {dimensionless}
    0.00,                 !- Moisture Equation Coefficient b {dimensionless}
    0.00,                 !- Moisture Equation Coefficient c {dimensionless}
    0.00;                 !- Moisture Equation Coefficient d {dimensionless}
```

The proposed EMPD model will *add* the following:

```
    0.00,                !- Moisture Deep-layer Penetration Depth {m}
    0.00,                !- Material Moisture Permeability {kg/m-s-Pa}
```

For older versions of the .idf, the deep-layer depth will be set to zero and the permeability will be calculated based on the penetration depth and calculated slope of the moisture capacitance equation (derived from a-d coefficients), assuming a nominal temperature and humidity and 24 hours for the cycle period. See Eq. (5) and accompanying text in Janssen and Roels, 2009 for details.
