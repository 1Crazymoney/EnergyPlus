Input Changes version 22.1.0 to 22.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

**For Coil:Cooling:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit:**

The first ten fields remain the same, three new fields are then added for the reference temperatures. Default values are provided which corresponds to the value previously used.

See [PR#]()

**For Coil:Heating:WaterToAirHeatPump:EquationFit:**

The first nine fields remain the same, two new fields are then added for the reference temperatures and a new field that defines the ration of reference heating to cooling capacity is also added. Default values are provided which corresponds to the value previously used.
