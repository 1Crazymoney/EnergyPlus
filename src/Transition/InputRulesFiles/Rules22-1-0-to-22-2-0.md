Input Changes version 22.1.0 to 22.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: Coil:Cooling:DX:CurveFit:Speed

Fields 1-8 remain the same.
Field 9 is a new field that is defaulted to 934.4, and the transition will fill the field with 934.4

# Object Change: Coil:Heating:DX:MultiSpeed
# Object Change: FUELFACTORS

The second and third input parameters for the FuelFactors input syntax were eliminated because they were never used in the program.  Everything else that comes after it is simply shifted forward.

See: [FuelFactors: Units of Measures and Energy per Unit Factor are never used](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues/9493)


# Object Change: Space

Summary: 2 new fields were added to the Space object.

Field 1-2 remain the same.
New Field 3 Ceiling Height, defaults to autocalculate
New Field 4 Volume, defaults to autocalculate
Remaining fields remain the same, shifted down by 2 places.

See [PR#9394](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/9394)
