Input Changes version 23.1.0 to 23.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: Coil:Heating:Fuel

Fields 1-8, 10 remain the same.
Field 9 has a name change from "Parasitic Electric Load {W}" 
                            to "On Cycle Parasitic Electric Load {W}".
Field 11 has a name change from "Parasitic Fuel Load {W}" 
                             to "Off Cycle Parasitic Fuel Load {W}".
