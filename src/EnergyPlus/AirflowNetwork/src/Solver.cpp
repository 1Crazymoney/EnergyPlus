    // PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
    // This module is used to simulate airflows and pressures. The module is modified to
    // meet requirements of EnergyPLus based on AIRNET, developed by
    // National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

    // METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED:
    // An airflow network approach is used. It consists of nodes connected by airflow elements.
    // The Newton's method is applied to solve a sparse matrix. When a new solver is available, this
    // module will be replaced or updated.
