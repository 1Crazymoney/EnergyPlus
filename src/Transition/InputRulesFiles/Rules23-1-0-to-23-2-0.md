Input Changes version 23.1.0 to 23.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: Site:GroundTemperature:Undisturbed:Xing

Fields 1-4, 6-9 remain the same.
Field 5 has a name change from "Average Soil Surface Tempeature"
                            to "Average Soil Surface Temperature".
