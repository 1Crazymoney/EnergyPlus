NFP â€“ Dedicated OA to supply and inlet side of zone HVAC units

FSEC, B. Nigusse, April 26, 2016

(Based on NFP_OAtoZoneUnits.doc, dated July 27, 2011)



#Justification for Feature Update:
In its current form, EnergyPlus 8.5 allow a central dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) to provide conditioned outdoor air directly to the supply or the inlet side of *ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil* and *ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump* zoneHVAC equipment only. Such an arrangement is commonly used in current building design practices and should be extended to other zoneHVAC equipment in EnergyPlus. While there is a credible work-around in EnergyPlus version 8.5 that is thermodynamically similar to the supply side delivery arrangement described above, the OA from the central DOAS is delivered to the zone directly instead of being mixed with the supply air at supply node of the zoneHVAC equipment. This effort will extend such capability to ***ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner***, ***ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump***, or ***ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow*** zoneHVAC equipment. The total airflow delivered to the zone is important to be established as it helps in sizing of the duct work and supply registers for the zone, and is also the more commonly used arrangement in practice. In addition to the total airflow, supply air and outdoor air conditions may also be set taking into account the mixing taking place upstream or downstream.

#Overview:
The arrangements shown in Figure 1 is supported in EnergyPlus version 8.5 for 4PipeFanCoil and WSPTHP ZoneHVAC equipment only. A central DOAS provides fresh air to the zone mixed either at the inlet or outlet of a local zoneHVAC equipment that conditions the recirculation air.

To allow for this configuration, the two terminal unit mixer existing objects, *AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SupplySideMixer* and *AirTerminal:SingleDuct:InletSideMixer* are used. These mixer objects can be used with all the ZoneHVAC type terminal unit objects from the group *Zone Forced Air Units* except for *ZoneHVAC:OutdoorAirUnit*, *ZoneHVAC:Dehumidifier:DX* and *ZoneHVAC:EnergyRecoveryVentilator*. The proposed task will add such capability to the following zoneHVAC equipment:

1. **ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner**
2. **ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalHeatPump**
3. **ZoneHVAC:TerminalUnit:VariableRefrigerantFlow**

#Approach:
Two existing terminal unit mixer objects ***AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SupplySideMixer*** and ***AirTerminal:SingleDuct:InletSideMixer*** in *Air Distribution Equipment* group will be used. A terminal unit mixer object provides the zoneHVAC equipment object type and object name, and three node names: primary air inlet node name, secondary air inlet node name, and an air outlet node name. Each mixer object will sum the airflows and average the air properties of the two incoming streams and deliver mixed air either to the zone supply node or the inlet of the local zoneHVAC equipment. The total supply air delivered to a zone is equal to the sum of the primary air and the recirculating air. The primary air flow is balanced with the zone return air flow. This is done automatically in the subroutine *CalcZoneMassBalance*, module *ZoneEqupmentManager*. These terminal units resemble the induction type terminal units: they mix supply air with recirculated zone air and deliver the mixed air into a zone. The mixer objects will contain a reference to the upstream or downstream allowed zoneHVAC equipment. If present, the mixers will be simulated and will be able to pass the zone *load met* taking into account the outdoor air conditions to the local zoneHVAC equipment calculation routines.     

###Testing/Validation/Data Source(s):
The new feature will be compared against exiting model.

###AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SupplySideMixer 
The *AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SupplySideMixer* object is used to mix conditioned outdoor air from a central dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with conditioned recirculation air from a local zonal HVAC unit to be supplied as a single stream to the zone at its inlet node. The mixer will sum the airflows and average the air properties of the two incoming streams. Currently, the *AirTerminal:SingleDuct:SupplySideMixer* is used with the *ZoneHVAC:FourPipeFanCoil* and *ZoneHVAC:WaterToAirHeatPump* objects. This effort will expand to other three zoneHVAC equipment.
