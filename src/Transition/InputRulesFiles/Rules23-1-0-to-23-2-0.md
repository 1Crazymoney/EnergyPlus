Input Changes version 23.1.0 to 23.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Key Note

For the release of 23.2, there are multiple changes around coil inputs.
Please read the notes here carefully, and if needed, compare 23.1 to 23.2 example files to see the changes made.

# Part Load Fraction Correlations

This change brings greater consistency in how part load performance is characterized across coils, and applies to any coil object where a new
"Part Load Fraction Correlation Curve" input is added per the "Object Changes" below. These coils now use a traditional
curve fit to characterize part load fraction as a function of part load ratio. The previous approach was more theoretical based on inputs
shared with the latent degradation model. An approximate conversion from the previous inputs to a linear part load fraction curve is described
below:

PLF(PLF) = (1 - Cd) + Cd * PLR

Thus calculating the new coefficient is:

Cd = A * (1 - exp(-1/A))

where:

- A = 4 * tau * (Nmax/3600)
- tau = Heat Pump Time Constant from parent or default 60s
- Nmax = Maximum Cycling Rate from parent or default 2.5/hr

Create a new `Curve:Linear` object for the heat pump Part Load Fraction correlation:

- Set "N1 , \field Coefficient1 Constant" to the calculated value of: `(1 - Cd)`
- Set "N2 , \field Coefficient2 x" to the calculated value of: `Cd`
- Set "N3 , \field Minimum Value of x" to: `0.0`
- Set "N4 , \field Maximum Value of x" to: `1.0`
- Set "N5 , \field Minimum Curve Output" to: `0.0`
- Set "N6 , \field Maximum Curve Output" to: `1.0`
- set "A2,  \field Input Unit Type for X" to: `Dimensionless`
- set "A3,  \field Output Unit Type" to: `Dimensionless`
