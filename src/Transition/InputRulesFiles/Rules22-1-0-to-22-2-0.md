Input Changes version 22.1.0 to 22.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Object Change: `People`

Field 1 through 11 (up till N6) remain the same.

After N6, insert two new numeric fields: N7 and N8. N7 for Cold Stress Temperature Threshold and N8 for Heat Stress Temperature Threshold. N7 has a default value of 15.56. N8 has a default value of 30. Shift all later fields down by 2. The labels of later fields do not change, and they stay as A6 - A21.
