Input Changes version 23.1.0 to 23.2.0
=============

This file documents the structural changes on the input of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.
This was previously an Excel workbook that made for very difficult version control, especially during busy times around code freezes.

# Part Load Fraction Correlation

There are a few object changes below that are related to the cycling and latent degradation inputs.
Some of these require a calculation to get the new input.
The correlation being applied is: 

(1 - Cd) + Cd * PLR

Thus calculating the new coefficient is:

Cd = A * (1 - exp(-1/A))

where:

- A = 4 * tau * (Nmax/3600)
- tau = Heat Pump Time Constant from parent or default 60s
- Nmax = Maximum Cycling Rate from parent or default 2.5/hr
